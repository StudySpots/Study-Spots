# Study-Spots

1. Download or clone this branch (Swift 2)



2. Download the mongo db local server (https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) and extract it somewhere you can find it.



3. Create a folder in your C:// drive called "data" and a folder inside of data called "db"



4. Open Terminal and run: npm install -g nodemon 
  (Installing nodemon globally, great for autoreloading app constantly, REALLY helpful with auto-save ide like visual studio code to constantly see changes made live)



 5. Change the terminal directory to your study spots "cd ".../.../study-spots""



 6. run npm install, LEAVE THIS TERMINAL WINDOW OPEN TO SAVE TIME



 7. Open a new terminal window and change directory to the mongodb folder you extracted and change directory to the bin folder inside. 



 8. Type "mongod" to run the application and start the local DB.



 9. Open the other terminal window in studyspots and type "nodemon server.js"



 10. The Site should be available at localhost:8080, if the DB is not connected (will state), check your port in the MONGO terminal and change it in server.js



 11. Read through the code and see the format of implementation. 



 Recommended Tools: Visual Studio Code, Robo 3T (Viewing the local DB)
